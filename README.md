# NoseCam  

NoseCam is something I created to stabilize (de-spin) high power rocket flight videos.  It also forms the basis for a Vertical Orientation Control (VOC) system.  What I am sharing in this distribution does NOT contain info on the VOC subsystem.  That being said, if you manage to successfully build and fly a NoseCam using what I am sharing here then you are 90% of the way to having a VOC system.  Almost everything you need is already here.  You “just” have to add the needed components to the upper nose (servo(s), winglets/canards, etc.) and write some additional code.  

The Rocketry Form (TRF) is where I have been posting everything I’ve been doing with NoseCam.  Here are some useful links to posts:

I plan on continuing to use TRF as the only location where I will answer questions.  So if you have a question, post it to the “Falcon NoseCam Build Thread” on TRF.
