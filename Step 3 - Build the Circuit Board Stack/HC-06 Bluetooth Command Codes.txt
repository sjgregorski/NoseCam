NOTE - Some modules are very fussy while trying to program them.  After the AT command, they may require CR+LF, nothing, or some other combo

Command examples:

AT+NAME

AT+VERSION

AT+NAME57600BDPWD1234

AT+BAUD7

AT+PIN1234



Most useful AT commands are

AT : Check the connection.
AT+NAME : See default name
AT+ADDR : see default address
AT+VERSION : See version
AT+UART : See baudrate
AT+ROLE: See role of bt module(1=master/0=slave)
AT+RESET : Reset and exit AT mode
AT+ORGL : Restore factory settings
AT+PSWD: see default password


Setting the Baud Rate:

1 set to 1200bps
2 set to 2400bps
3 set to 4800bps
4 set to 9600bps (Default)
5 set to 19200bps
6 set to 38400bps
7 set to 57600bps
8 set to 115200bps
so sending AT+BAUD4 will set the baud rate to 9600.
